javascript-api-extensions
=========================

Just another bunch of extensions; mostly to JavaScript's core api.
This battlefield is outdated/unsupported and gets used mainly as "code quarry".

Most of this stuff reaches back as far as 2003 but found its way
into another project - https://github.com/petsel/composable .
